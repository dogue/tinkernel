# tinkernel

This project is a toy operating system in Odin. It is very early development and will never be ready nor recommended for real use.

Nevertheless, I welcome to you take a look at it in all it's awfulness. If you'd like start a similar project, you can find some useful links below.

The name is a double play on words, "tin kernel" as in "flimsy", and (tinker)nel as in tinkering with things.
